  <h1>Not Everything Has to be Social</h1>
  <p>I agree tapping into my social network makes a lot of things better: Quora, Foursquare, <span class="caps">CNN</span>.com, and Flickr are all better if I can find my friends from Facebook using those services.</p>
<p>But some services aren&#8217;t necessarily better just because you add your social network.</p>
<p>Beyond privacy concerns (for example, Google Health obviously isn&#8217;t better if all my friends can see my health records), there are services where interacting with strangers is better than interacting with friends.</p>
<h3>Examples</h3>
<p>A simple example: When I am in a new city looking for a sushi restaurant, I don&#8217;t really care what my friends liked when they were there. I care what the sushi experts in that city like. While I love seeing what my friends think about businesses in San Francisco when I&#8217;m browsing Yelp, I wouldn&#8217;t necessarily care (or trust) what they think about Boston if I were stuck in a blizzard looking for a quick dinner.</p>
<p>Another example: Most of my friends aren&#8217;t fashion experts. I don&#8217;t really care what they recommend on a clothing site. I&#8217;d like fashion recommendations curated by people who are passionate about fashion whether I know them or not. While some of those people might be my friends, most of them won&#8217;t be.</p>
