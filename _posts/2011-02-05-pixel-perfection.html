<p>Does a 1-pixel mistake in a design <em>really</em> matter?</p>

<p>A lot of designers have been posting screenshots of other's designs (mostly Apple UI) pointing out minor imperfections. Finding other people's mistakes is a fun game to play, especially when there is no name associated with the design. But it's not challenging. And it's not designing.</p>

<p>Seeing 1-pixel mistakes without zooming in is actually a pretty useful skill if you're a designer. But it's only useful if you're using it on your own designs or designs you have a chance to work on.</p>

<p>If you want to point out minor mistakes made by Apple's designers, send them to Apple's designers. Don't post them to a Twitter feed with the implication you'd do better. Especially when I can visit your website and see you <em>don't</em> do better.</p>

<p>Every designer defines design differently but I think almost everyone agrees that design is about solving problems.</p>

<p>As designers we should strive for perfection, even down to the last pixel. But in the real world there are constraints, deadlines, and plenty of other pressures that impact a design. Sometimes we even make "design typos" and mess things up by a pixel or two. So we do the best we can within the constraints. Sometimes that means our work is less than perfect.</p>

<p>That's okay.</p>

<p>I don't know of any designer who does perfect work all the time. Before attacking others for their minor mistakes, people should focus on making their own designs pixel perfect.</p>
