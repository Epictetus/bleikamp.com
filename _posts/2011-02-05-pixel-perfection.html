<p>Does a 1-pixel mistake in a design <em>really</em> matter?</p>

<p>A lot of designers lately have been posting screenshots of other's designs (mostly Apple UI), pointing out little imperfections and asking how it was allowed to ship.</p>

<h3>Does it matter?</h3>

<p>The fact that we need to zoom in to 1600% (or even 3200%) to see these mistakes says to me that they don't really matter. They don't stop people from using an application in the way it was intended to be used.</p>

<p>Did the 1-pixel impact user experience? Nope.</p>

<o>Do most people even notice it? Nope.</o>

<h3>The other side</h3>

<p>I know there is an argument to be made that great designer care about every pixel and I respect that. I try to care about every pixel in my designs, but of course I miss things and make mistakes.</p>

<p>The real measure of whether a design is successful should be whether or not it achieves its goal.</p>

<p>I don't know of any designer who does perfect work all the time. Before attacking others for their minor mistakes, people should focus on making their own designs pixel perfect.</p>

<h3>Design isâ€¦</h3>

<p>Every designer defines design differently but I think almost everyone agrees that design is about solving problems.</p>

<p>Should we strive for pixel perfection? Sure. But in the real world there are constraints, deadlines, and plenty of other pressures that impact a design. So we do the best we can within the constraints. Sometimes that means our work is less than perfect.</p>

<p>That's okay.</p>
